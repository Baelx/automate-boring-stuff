## [Guide](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

Instead of using the recommended environment of IDLE, I'm using the regular python3 REPL in the command line and nano(so far) as my editor.

In my code, I've also chosen to start using underscores for variables instead of camelcase - as per [the python style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). I may change my mind later.
